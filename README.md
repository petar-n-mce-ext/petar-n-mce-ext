# 👋 Hej!

Welcome to my little corner of GitHub 👨‍💻✨

## 🚀 About Me
- 🔭 I'm constantly exploring the world of **cutting-edge tech** — think AI, ML, and cloud wizardry ☁️🤖
- 🛠️ I build sleek and scalable **full-stack apps** with a strong toolkit: `JavaScript`, `TypeScript`, `Node.js`, `Go`, and more.
- 🌱 Currently on a deep dive into **machine learning** and **Ai Engineering** (RAG, LLM magic, you name it).
- 🧠 Obsessed with clean architecture, high-performance systems, and automating *all the things*.
- 🎯 Always chasing the next big challenge — whether it's optimizing a backend service or bringing an idea to life with a polished front-end.

## 💡 Fun Facts
- I may or may not be powered by ☕ coffee and late-night coding sessions.
- I believe in *learning by building*, and there's always a side project (or three) on the go.
- Favorite debugging strategy: 1) Panic. 2) Google. 3) Fix it like a boss 💪
